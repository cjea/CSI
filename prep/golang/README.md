Write a concurrent program that creates a local mirror of a web site, fetching each reachable page and writing it to a directory on the local disk. Only pages within the original domain (for instance,golang.org) should be fetched. URLs within the mirrored pages should be altered as needed so that they refer to the mirrored page, not the original.
